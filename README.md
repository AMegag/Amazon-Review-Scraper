# Amazon Review Scraper
This project takes the product name and brand alongside customer reviews from Amazon including star ratings, text reviews, and country. 
You may need to change the website path etc dependant upon which Amazon website you're looking to scrape. 
Please check Amazons Terms and Conditions prior to scraping and only if this is deemed ok by them should you proceed.

Last tested 7.4.23 I won't be updating this and a few things on the site may change. If you do find updates whilst using this though please contribute to the project.

Have fun!
